Approach #3 (Optimal) [Accepted]
The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. For example, the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's n-1nâˆ’1 times, which is not necessary. We could have instead written just once. How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.

The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position or a position earlier. If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the current position by 0 right away,so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.

In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:
  1. All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
  2. All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
